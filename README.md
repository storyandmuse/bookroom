reading

for the most part

is a solitary experience

usually

only after

we have read a book

on our own

by ourselves

do we reach out

to others

to share

the experience

in book clubs

class discussions

or social media forums

but

what if

we could

connect

with each other

in real time

as we turn the pages

what if

we could

read

with each other

in real time

as we twist in plots

self-help ourselves

and vanquish villains

we could

switch between

the solitary

and the social

with a swipe

or a tap

if

there were

an app…

that could

transform

each chapter

of an ebook

into a live chat

like a chatroom

but a bookroom

moderated

by users

for spoilers

and of course

for all other

expected irritations

found in most

anonymous online settings

we could

watch our fellow

readers’ reactions

scroll right

alongside

the page

and engage

with them

if we choose

or we could

shut out

and shut up

all of the chatter

read in our accustomed

silence and solitude

until that moment

in every good book

when we are in tears

or shocked out of our chairs

or doubled over in laughter

when we just have to share

with someone

what havoc

mere words

have just wrought

upon our precious paradigms

if we had

this app…

we could

in that moment

invite our friends

to meet us in the book

to join us on the page

we could revisit

the story’s sorcery

all over again

together

and if there were

a way to keep tabs

on our friends’ progress

we could

pressure them

perhaps

to read faster

to catch up

to some milestone

in the hero’s journey

we could

leave notes for them

on bookmarked pages

that they could

save or

respond to

so we could have

layers of connectivity

from the purist lone read

to the invite-only read with friends

to the communal read with all readers

of the same book

this could be fun

someone please build this

thanks :)
